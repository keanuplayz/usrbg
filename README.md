## Importing the Database

```css
@import url('https://keanuplayz.github.io/usrbg/dist/usrbg.css');
```

This will import the USRBG database. Alone, it's simply some variables. Some of examples on how it can be utilized can be seen in the [Snippets](https://github.com/keanuplayz/usrbg/tree/master/snippets) folder of this repo.

## Important

If you are using BetterDiscord, you MUST have a plugin by devilbro running, as USRBG requires his lib for certain important data attributes.

## Approved Request Locations

All requests are processed manually by [@keanuplayz](https://github.com/keanuplayz).

All requests MUST be hosted on i.imgur.com or cdn.discordapp.com, or unsplash.com. Selfhosting will not be allowed, as this causes a security vulnerability when mass-distributing content to users.
